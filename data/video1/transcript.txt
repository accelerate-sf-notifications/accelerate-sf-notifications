11:31 And then now that they are

15:59 Item 22 is an ordinance to amend
16:01 the administrative code retire
16:04 chief to adopt a foot and bike
16:05 patrol strategy for the police
16:05 department.
16:07 >> supervisor safai.
16:10 >>mented take a moment to talk
16:12 about item 22.
16:13 Foot patrols.
16:16 Appreciate all my cosponsors I
16:18 think that I have supervisor
16:22 supervisor peskin, engardio,
16:26 walton, ronen, stefani, dorsey,
16:29 and -- melgar, chan.
16:31 I think we almost have everybody
16:31 on board.
16:34 >> sorry trying to remember off
16:35 the top.
16:37 Supervisor chan, thank you.
16:40 >> for your early support.
16:41 [Laughter].
16:43 But this is something
16:47 colleagues, I think we discussed
16:49 for a number of years and we
16:52 want to see police presence back
16:53 in the community regardless the
16:55 number of officers we have
16:58 within the department.
17:00 This is something that true
17:02 community policing is building
17:04 trust within the community,
17:06 presence in that community.
17:07 Supervisor engardio asked for
17:08 there to be bike.
17:11 We did that, thank you for that
17:12 suggestion I think that was an
17:16 oversight appreciate that foot
17:17 and bike patrol.
17:19 The truth circumstance
17:21 colleagues when police are
17:22 present in the community, crime
17:24 guess down were not about
17:26 arresting people it is knowing
17:28 the mount and the patterns of
17:29 the community and having those
17:31 there that are knowledgeable and
17:32 can be present.
17:35 So for the first time, this
17:37 legislation will require no
17:39 longer urges but will require
17:42 the chief to work with every
17:44 single police captain in the
17:45 city.
17:47 And over the next 2 months they
17:48 will come up with a plan.
17:50 The resource are there.
17:51 This is will not require
17:52 additional resources.
17:54 Right now it is optional.
17:56 The money is there for optional
17:59 foot patrols we are saying the
18:01 time in for this to be required
18:03 in every part of the city not
18:05 just selective parts of san
18:05 francisco.
18:07 We think this is the right thing
18:10 to dog at this moment I will
18:12 will thank supervisor walton and
18:14 he and hene did.
18:16 We built that and amend third
18:17 degree to make turned the
18:20 chief's pursue and med it more
18:22 present and current with the
18:24 requests that are manage from
18:24 today.
18:25 I thank you will have an
18:27 immediate impact on when we are
18:30 seeing and some of the trends in
18:33 san francisco having police and
18:34 in the communities doing true
18:35 community policing will have a
18:37 significant impact on san
18:38 francisco employment to thank
18:41 all the coresponsibleses and the
18:41 chief.
18:44 And the commission for working
18:48 with us and I believe once this
18:49 happens beginning JANUARY 1,
18:51 we'll begin to see significant
18:52 improvement in the way san
18:54 francisco is viewed and the way
18:58 the community views the police.
19:00 Lastly, also one thing we talked
19:01 about yesterday supervisor
19:03 walton, myself and dorsey is
19:05 that well is a morale issue.
19:08 There is a desire to be part of
19:09 this police department.
19:11 and I think that once community
19:13 are back officers are back in
19:15 the community, and intrakting
19:16 with the community.
19:20 On a daily basis, it will help
19:23 to increase morale and
19:23 understanding from the police
19:24 department and their
19:25 interactions with the community.
19:27 I think this is over all going
19:29 to have a significant, positive
19:29 impact.
19:32 Happy to have worked on that and
19:34 happy this will happen in the
19:36 next months as of JANUARY one,
19:37 we'll see that and on going
19:41 there will being discussions at
19:42 the commission with the chiefa
19:44 plans are presented annually.
19:47 With that, colleagues I -- look
19:49 forward to your support or

19:51 any.

22:58 Colleagues I'm today submitting
23:00 a drafting request to the city
23:03 attorney and controller that
23:05 will continue in needed
23:06 conversation about the crisis of
23:09 police under staffing in san
23:09 francisco.
23:11 The rules yesterday considered
23:14 my charter amendment to address
23:16 police staffing with a measured
23:18 evidence based 5 year plan.
23:21 The substantive core was amend
23:24 over my oksz I will not litigate
23:25 that here we will have
23:26 opportunity as a board of
23:28 supervisors to debate the merits
23:32 now a reimagined version as
23:33 amended.
23:34 However I heard a specific piece
23:36 of feedback from a colleague
23:38 yesterday I think is worthwhile.
23:40 Many times during the committee
23:44 meeting it was noted the
23:47 provisions of the measure those
23:48 tieing dollars to otherwise
23:50 empty wordos paper did not need
23:52 to be in a ballot measure the
23:55 mayor and this board on any
23:57 given tuesday could enact them.
23:59 Taking that add voice to heart
24:01 and honoring ideas put forward
24:03 by colleagues and others from
24:06 yesterday submitting a drafting
24:08 question the proposed to
24:10 accomplish 2 things.
24:12 Create a police full staffing
24:15 fund receiving ref nows for the
24:16 purposes identified in the
24:19 original proposal and 2,
24:21 reappropriation of 8.4 million
24:23 dollars in the current fiscal
24:25 budget to support more
24:25 recruiting.
24:27 Described in the full staffing
24:30 if you meaned that is 1 half the
24:32 amount in the proposed charter
24:34 amendment representing half the
24:37 fiscal year to move with the
25:06 urgency the crisis deserves
25:07 thank you.
25:11 Supervisor engardio I am dressed
25:14 as the character joy from inside
25:14 out.
25:16 My staff is the other
25:17 characteristic of the movie.
25:23 It takes all the emotions to
25:25 deal with the challenge in san
25:27 francisco we must lead with joy.
25:29 I know we need to lay foundation
25:33 of good foundations for public
25:36 safety, education, housing and
25:40 our local economy we doll this
25:43 so all can have a joyful live.
25:45 Celebrate joy in san francisco
25:47 as we create more.
25:47 Thank you.
25:51 >> rest I submit.
25:54 [Laughter].
25:56 [Applause] Supervisor mandelman.
25:58 I have no joy.
26:01 >> no.
26:03 [Laughter].
26:08 I have a charter reform drafting
26:08 request, everybody.
26:11 As well as a resolution.
26:15 First on the charter reform
26:17 drafting request we asked the
26:20 city attorney to appropriate a
26:22 governors charter reform
26:23 peculiarage for the NOVEMBER 24
26:25 ballot in the hopes of
26:27 delivering more decisionmaking
26:28 at city hall and effective
26:30 administration of city
26:31 departments.
26:33 As you MAY have noticed there
26:35 has been a bit of talk of reform
26:40 as oflet in AUGUST the mc kena
26:41 colleges rose state and local
26:43 gentleman released a report
26:45 refurthermores to city charter
26:48 to expand mayoral xours reform
26:50 the ballot measure and
26:51 commission system.
26:54 Some floated a 2024 charter
26:56 amendment to change how the
26:58 redistricting task force is
26:59 selectd and votes to elect the
27:02 board of supervisors and former
27:04 supervisors issue senator and
27:07 judge offered his own measure
27:09 for election of supervisors and
27:12 spur neighborhood I press to
27:14 review the chart and will issue
27:18 its set of proposed reforms.
27:19 Concern our city government is
27:22 broken is of course, not new.
27:25 It was 15 years ago that joe
27:26 labeled san francisco the worse
27:29 run big city in the us.
27:32 However, it has seemed to meet
27:35 hunger for a better city is
27:37 palpable and felt today to
27:39 create now opportunity to look
27:40 at our chart and consider better
27:43 ways of doing things.
27:45 To thaenldz I and my staff have
27:47 been having conversations with
27:48 mart folks inside this build and
27:50 outside the building the last
27:53 several months or longer to
27:55 identify a set of reforms that
27:58 might be to win support in city
28:00 hall with voters and leave our
28:03 government in shape to dot work
28:04 our peep expect.
28:07 We have sick concepts the first
28:10 4 I believe are baked.
28:13 The last are continuing to be
28:14 process exclude considered.
28:18 And shaped by stake holders.
28:21 The first is to repeal a
28:23 prohibition on deputy mayors in
28:26 the charter and has for
28:27 detectived.
28:29 It envisions a mirrial
28:31 administration that sits back
28:35 and allows commission and other
28:39 officials to govern the city
28:41 without oversight for a mayor's
28:42 office.
28:44 I think we need an executive tht
28:46 city and makes sense to have
28:48 that person able to use people
28:50 like deputy mayors and so I
28:52 being the least we should take
28:54 that prohibition out.
28:57 So I'm proposing we do that
28:57 second.
29:00 I'm proposing allow the mayor
29:03 authority to fire directors of
29:05 most of the departments that are
29:07 over seen by commissions.
29:11 We talk about how we have a
29:13 strong mayor system.
29:14 In many ways we do.
29:17 But we check the powerhouse of
29:19 the mayor and many ways that is
29:19 important.
29:22 And the charter check otmayor's
29:24 authority to hire department
29:27 head system intended deter in
29:29 taoism and I don't know I didn't
29:30 mean and shared process elevate
29:33 a diverse pool of qualified
29:35 candidates providing the mayor
29:38 with the ability to get rid of
29:40 directors of departments in the
29:41 branch would claire fight chain
29:44 of command and allow the mir to
29:46 act when the mayor felt the
29:49 change was needvscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.htmled.
29:56 Third, voteo commission to have
29:59 split appointmentos bodies the
30:01 mayor can reject mayoral
30:02 appointments.
