00:10:52 This is not because we don't
00:10:55 endorse the work that japanese
00:10:57 community youth council has done
00:10:59 through the opportunity for all.
00:11:02 In fact, we are grateful for the
00:11:03 service.
00:11:05 And the last decades.
00:11:06 For a time.
00:11:09 What this is, though system that
00:11:12 we just to as a remindser came
00:11:16 before us in a pass an item that
00:11:19 was identified last year that --
00:11:22 you know the contract in its
00:11:23 totality should have come to the
00:11:25 board for approval.
00:11:27 So it was retroactive approval
00:11:29 to start off with.
00:11:31 And then now that they are
00:11:33 coming back for additional not
00:11:35 to exceed because there seems to
00:11:39 be a discrepancy in terms of

00:12:04 it was with that our budget and
00:12:06 analyst recommended an audit

00:12:36 That we want our city
00:12:36 departments to figure out
00:12:40 structural changes so we are do
00:12:42 better to track our dataa making

00:15:40 21 was also not forwarded to the
00:15:42 board as a committee report.
00:15:45 >> item 22, was recommended as
00:15:48 amended bearing a new title
00:15:49 strike the requirement for the
00:15:51 police commission to hold

00:16:01 the administrative code retire
00:16:04 chief to adopt a foot and bike
00:16:05 patrol strategy for the police
00:16:05 department.
00:16:07 >> supervisor safai.
00:16:10 >>mented take a moment to talk
00:16:12 about item 22.
00:16:13 Foot patrols.
00:16:16 Appreciate all my cosponsors I
00:16:18 think that I have supervisor
00:16:22 supervisor peskin, engardio,
00:16:26 walton, ronen, stefani, dorsey,
00:16:29 and -- melgar, chan.
00:16:31 I think we almost have everybody
00:16:31 on board.
00:16:34 >> sorry trying to remember off
00:16:35 the top.
00:16:37 Supervisor chan, thank you.
00:16:40 >> for your early support.
00:16:41 [Laughter].
00:16:43 But this is something
00:16:47 colleagues, I think we discussed
00:16:49 for a number of years and we
00:16:52 want to see police presence back
00:16:53 in the community regardless the
00:16:55 number of officers we have
00:16:58 within the department.
00:17:00 This is something that true
00:17:02 community policing is building
00:17:04 trust within the community,
00:17:06 presence in that community.
00:17:07 Supervisor engardio asked for
00:17:08 there to be bike.
00:17:11 We did that, thank you for that
00:17:12 suggestion I think that was an
00:17:16 oversight appreciate that foot
00:17:17 and bike patrol.
00:17:19 The truth circumstance
00:17:21 colleagues when police are
00:17:22 present in the community, crime
00:17:24 guess down were not about
00:17:26 arresting people it is knowing
00:17:28 the mount and the patterns of
00:17:29 the community and having those
00:17:31 there that are knowledgeable and
00:17:32 can be present.
00:17:35 So for the first time, this
00:17:37 legislation will require no
00:17:39 longer urges but will require
00:17:42 the chief to work with every
00:17:44 single police captain in the
00:17:45 city.
00:17:47 And over the next 2 months they
00:17:48 will come up with a plan.
00:17:50 The resource are there.
00:17:51 This is will not require
00:17:52 additional resources.
00:17:54 Right now it is optional.
00:17:56 The money is there for optional
00:17:59 foot patrols we are saying the
00:18:01 time in for this to be required
00:18:03 in every part of the city not
00:18:05 just selective parts of san
00:18:05 francisco.
00:18:07 We think this is the right thing
00:18:10 to dog at this moment I will
00:18:12 will thank supervisor walton and
00:18:14 he and hene did.
00:18:16 We built that and amend third
00:18:17 degree to make turned the
00:18:20 chief's pursue and med it more
00:18:22 present and current with the
00:18:24 requests that are manage from
00:18:24 today.
00:18:25 I thank you will have an
00:18:27 immediate impact on when we are
00:18:30 seeing and some of the trends in
00:18:33 san francisco having police and
00:18:34 in the communities doing true
00:18:35 community policing will have a
00:18:37 significant impact on san
00:18:38 francisco employment to thank
00:18:41 all the coresponsibleses and the
00:18:41 chief.
00:18:44 And the commission for working
00:18:48 with us and I believe once this
00:18:49 happens beginning JANUARY 1,
00:18:51 we'll begin to see significant
00:18:52 improvement in the way san
00:18:54 francisco is viewed and the way
00:18:58 the community views the police.
00:19:00 Lastly, also one thing we talked
00:19:01 about yesterday supervisor
00:19:03 walton, myself and dorsey is
00:19:05 that well is a morale issue.
00:19:08 There is a desire to be part of
00:19:09 this police department.
00:19:11 and I think that once community
00:19:13 are back officers are back in
00:19:15 the community, and intrakting
00:19:16 with the community.
00:19:20 On a daily basis, it will help
00:19:23 to increase morale and
00:19:23 understanding from the police
00:19:24 department and their
00:19:25 interactions with the community.
00:19:27 I think this is over all going
00:19:29 to have a significant, positive
00:19:29 impact.
00:19:32 Happy to have worked on that and
00:19:34 happy this will happen in the
00:19:36 next months as of JANUARY one,
00:19:37 we'll see that and on going
00:19:41 there will being discussions at

00:22:57 .
00:22:58 Colleagues I'm today submitting
00:23:00 a drafting request to the city
00:23:03 attorney and controller that
00:23:05 will continue in needed
00:23:06 conversation about the crisis of
00:23:09 police under staffing in san
00:23:09 francisco.
00:23:11 The rules yesterday considered
00:23:14 my charter amendment to address
00:23:16 police staffing with a measured
00:23:18 evidence based 5 year plan.
00:23:21 The substantive core was amend
00:23:24 over my oksz I will not litigate
00:23:25 that here we will have
00:23:26 opportunity as a board of
00:23:28 supervisors to debate the merits
00:23:32 now a reimagined version as
00:23:33 amended.
00:23:34 However I heard a specific piece
00:23:36 of feedback from a colleague
00:23:38 yesterday I think is worthwhile.
00:23:40 Many times during the committee
00:23:44 meeting it was noted the
00:23:47 provisions of the measure those
00:23:48 tieing dollars to otherwise
00:23:50 empty wordos paper did not need
00:23:52 to be in a ballot measure the
00:23:55 mayor and this board on any
00:23:57 given tuesday could enact them.
00:23:59 Taking that add voice to heart
00:24:01 and honoring ideas put forward
00:24:03 by colleagues and others from
00:24:06 yesterday submitting a drafting
00:24:08 question the proposed to
00:24:10 accomplish 2 things.
00:24:12 Create a police full staffing
00:24:15 fund receiving ref nows for the
00:24:16 purposes identified in the
00:24:19 original proposal and 2,
00:24:21 reappropriation of 8.4 million
00:24:23 dollars in the current fiscal
00:24:25 budget to support more
00:24:25 recruiting.
00:24:27 Described in the full staffing
00:24:30 if you meaned that is 1 half the
00:24:32 amount in the proposed charter
00:24:34 amendment representing half the
00:24:37 fiscal year to move with the
00:25:06 urgency the crisis deserves
00:25:07 thank you.
00:25:11 Supervisor engardio I am dressed
00:25:14 as the character joy from inside
00:25:14 out.
00:25:16 My staff is the other
00:25:17 characteristic of the movie.
00:25:23 It takes all the emotions to
00:25:25 deal with the challenge in san
00:25:27 francisco we must lead with joy.
00:25:29 I know we need to lay foundation
00:25:33 of good foundations for public
00:25:36 safety, education, housing and
00:25:40 our local economy we doll this
00:25:43 so all can have a joyful live.
00:25:45 Celebrate joy in san francisco
00:25:47 as we create more.
00:25:47 Thank you.
00:25:51 >> rest I submit.
00:25:54 [Laughter].
00:25:56 [Applause] Supervisor mandelman.
00:25:58 I have no joy.
00:26:01 >> no.
00:26:03 [Laughter].
00:26:08 I have a charter reform drafting
00:26:08 request, everybody.
00:26:11 As well as a resolution.
00:26:15 First on the charter reform
00:26:17 drafting request we asked the
00:26:20 city attorney to appropriate a
00:26:22 governors charter reform
00:26:23 peculiarage for the NOVEMBER 24
00:26:25 ballot in the hopes of
00:26:27 delivering more decisionmaking
00:26:28 at city hall and effective
00:26:30 administration of city
00:26:31 departments.
00:26:33 As you MAY have noticed there
00:26:35 has been a bit of talk of reform
00:26:40 as oflet in AUGUST the mc kena
00:26:41 colleges rose state and local
00:26:43 gentleman released a report
00:26:45 refurthermores to city charter
00:26:48 to expand mayoral xours reform
00:26:50 the ballot measure and
00:26:51 commission system.
00:26:54 Some floated a 2024 charter
00:26:56 amendment to change how the
00:26:58 redistricting task force is
00:26:59 selectd and votes to elect the
00:27:02 board of supervisors and former
00:27:04 supervisors issue senator and
00:27:07 judge offered his own measure
00:27:09 for election of supervisors and
00:27:12 spur neighborhood I press to
00:27:14 review the chart and will issue
00:27:18 its set of proposed reforms.
00:27:19 Concern our city government is
00:27:22 broken is of course, not new.
00:27:25 It was 15 years ago that joe
00:27:26 labeled san francisco the worse
00:27:29 run big city in the us.
00:27:32 However, it has seemed to meet
00:27:35 hunger for a better city is
00:27:37 palpable and felt today to
00:27:39 create now opportunity to look
00:27:40 at our chart and consider better
00:27:43 ways of doing things.
00:27:45 To thaenldz I and my staff have
00:27:47 been having conversations with
00:27:48 mart folks inside this build and
00:27:50 outside the building the last
00:27:53 several months or longer to
00:27:55 identify a set of reforms that
00:27:58 might be to win support in city
00:28:00 hall with voters and leave our
00:28:03 government in shape to dot work
00:28:04 our peep expect.
00:28:07 We have sick concepts the first
00:28:10 4 I believe are baked.
00:28:13 The last are continuing to be
00:28:14 process exclude considered.
00:28:18 And shaped by stake holders.
00:28:21 The first is to repeal a
00:28:23 prohibition on deputy mayors in
00:28:26 the charter and has for
00:28:27 detectived.
00:28:29 It envisions a mirrial
00:28:31 administration that sits back
00:28:35 and allows commission and other
00:28:39 officials to govern the city
00:28:41 without oversight for a mayor's
00:28:42 office.
00:28:44 I think we need an executive tht
00:28:46 city and makes sense to have
00:28:48 that person able to use people
00:28:50 like deputy mayors and so I
00:28:52 being the least we should take
00:28:54 that prohibition out.
00:28:57 So I'm proposing we do that
00:28:57 second.
00:29:00 I'm proposing allow the mayor
00:29:03 authority to fire directors of
00:29:05 most of the departments that are
00:29:07 over seen by commissions.
00:29:11 We talk about how we have a
00:29:13 strong mayor system.
00:29:14 In many ways we do.
00:29:17 But we check the powerhouse of
00:29:19 the mayor and many ways that is
00:29:19 important.
00:29:22 And the charter check otmayor's
00:29:24 authority to hire department
00:29:27 head system intended deter in
00:29:29 taoism and I don't know I didn't
00:29:30 mean and shared process elevate
00:29:33 a diverse pool of qualified
00:29:35 candidates providing the mayor
00:29:38 with the ability to get rid of
00:29:40 directors of departments in the
00:29:41 branch would claire fight chain
00:29:44 of command and allow the mir to
00:29:46 act when the mayor felt the
00:29:49 change was needed.
00:29:56 Third, voteo commission to have
00:29:59 split appointmentos bodies the
00:30:01 mayor can reject mayoral
00:30:02 appointments.
00:30:04 Where as the board can block
00:30:07 mayoral appointments that the
00:30:12 mayor has no check on board
00:30:16 appointments.
00:30:19 I hope you will agree.
00:30:21 >> and forth.
00:30:23 The board of supervisors is the
00:30:25 legislative body of the city and
00:30:26 county of san francisco.
00:30:28 I think it make sense for us to
00:30:31 dot work of legislating and yet
00:30:33 our charter provides a minority
00:30:35 of the body to got voters with
00:30:37 initiative ordinance and the
00:30:39 mayor to go to the voters with
00:30:40 initiative ordinances.
00:30:43 I think we should do our job of
00:30:45 legislating inside city hall and
00:30:49 so we I am proposing this we
00:30:51 take away this city hall
00:30:53 business of putting initiatives
00:30:55 to voters and weigh in.
00:30:58 There will be a check if than I
00:31:00 see city hall can't get
00:31:02 something didn't power of voter
00:31:06 initiatives I think it would
00:31:08 behoove us and reduce
00:31:11 [Inaudible] In this building to
00:31:13 have the board pass legislation
00:31:16 but not be putting this off on
00:31:19 to the voters.
00:31:20 Fifth, I think we.
00:31:24 Rekz niez we have a pluthera of
00:31:25 commissions and oversight body
00:31:28 and they seem to grow over time.
00:31:30 Supervisor engardio has looked
00:31:32 at this problem and lots
00:31:35 identified this problem and we
00:31:37 have no framework for trimming
00:31:39 that or stream lining that and
00:31:41 over time they are going to
00:31:41 grow.
00:31:45 Well is a cost to the city and
00:31:47 city staff and oversight bodies
00:31:49 and I don't think that we get
00:31:51 the benefits that people think
00:31:55 we will get from moreover
00:31:58 assignment I don't think it
00:32:00 necessarily leads to
00:32:03 transparency or better decision
00:32:05 making and wasteful.
00:32:07 I'm hopeing measure can describe
00:32:09 a regular process to stream line
00:32:10 the bodies proliferate over
00:32:11 time.
00:32:13 We are working with the city
00:32:15 attorney and stake holders to
00:32:18 hone inspect on what how this
00:32:20 commission this commission or
00:32:22 task force that is stream lining
00:32:23 commissions would work.
00:32:27 But we are hope to get this
00:32:27 finalized.
00:32:29 The last concept that we are
00:32:32 asking the city attorney to help
00:32:35 us to think through is expansion
00:32:37 of the definition of local
00:32:40 emergency or identification of a
00:32:42 new category that would allow
00:32:44 you to take the benefits we got
00:32:46 from declaring an emergency
00:32:50 around covid to address our
00:32:52 challenges around homelessness
00:32:54 and street conditions and drug
00:32:56 over doses and thing this is MAY
00:33:01 not be new and presenting rate
00:33:02 challenges that exceed our
00:33:04 capacity to responded this is
00:33:05 hard.
00:33:06 Will respond and require a lot
00:33:08 of conversations and folks
00:33:09 potential low including
00:33:13 organized labor we will give it
00:33:14 a try.
00:33:18 And narrow that down that is my
00:33:18 list.
00:33:21 Not the end all and be all of
00:33:23 charter reform I expect many
00:33:25 other folks MAY be introducing
00:33:28 or floating their idea busy
00:33:29 charter reform.
00:33:31 I recognize trying to do this in
00:33:33 an election year will be hard
00:33:37 and men setting the tain for a
00:33:38 measure in 2026.
00:33:41 I hope and think we can go I
00:33:44 long wake to make more sense who
00:33:46 for who is mayor or sit on the
00:33:49 board next year and I want to
00:33:51 thank ross green in my office
00:33:53 for his work.
00:33:58 I want to thank our city control
00:34:01 and add administratoror board
00:34:03 PRESIDENT And shawn and the
00:34:03 mayor's office.

00:34:11 And other who is talked to me
00:34:13 over the left few months and
00:34:17 helped me think through the
00:34:18 motions.
00:34:20 Mentioning is in the any or all
00:34:22 of this is a good yes, I did
00:34:25 hope they will and I am hoping
00:34:26 our conversations can further
00:34:29 refine and finalize a consensus
00:34:32 measure we can feel good about
00:34:34 and the electorate will in
00:34:39 NOVEMBER and I want to thank our
00:34:40 deputy city attorney for
00:34:42 attention and collaboration as
00:34:45 we work through the.
00:34:48 Resolution to recognize united
00:34:50 against hate week 23 held
00:34:53 NOVEMBER 12-18.

00:35:24 phobia and violence around the
00:35:25 world.
00:35:27 United against hate week
00:35:30 provides san francisco to join

00:49:37 for introductions.
00:49:38 Supervisor melgar
00:49:38 >> submit.
00:49:40 >> supervisor supervisor peskin.
00:49:41 >> submit.
00:49:41 >> thank you.
00:49:43 >> and supervisor ronen.
00:49:46 >> thank you, colleagues.
00:49:47 Today I have 2 items.
00:49:50 First I want to mention that the
00:49:54 timing of this item is the first
00:49:55 item is interesting.
00:49:58 Because despite fact the board
00:50:00 has appropriated over 140
00:50:02 million dollars in the left 2
00:50:08 years to s sfpd supervisor dorse
00:50:10 pushes for more we had growing
00:50:15 number of vacancies up to 144
00:50:16 and our behavioral health
00:50:19 program and we have not heard a
00:50:21 word that is telling.
00:50:24 Today I'm introducing a
00:50:25 resolution calling on the
00:50:27 mayor's office and department of
00:50:30 human resources to initial an
00:50:32 emergency hiring plan with
00:50:34 recruitment and retention
00:50:35 incentives for behavioral health
00:50:39 care workers to fill our growing
00:50:42 city vacancy and city contracted
00:50:42 providers.
00:50:47 These are vacancies for critical
00:50:48 positions that address the
00:50:49 crisis we face in our city and
00:50:52 that are limiting the ability of
00:50:54 the department of public health
00:50:56 to aggress the over dose
00:50:57 epidemic.
00:51:01 Well is currently an
00:51:04 unpresidented workforce shortage
00:51:09 of behavioral healing workers.
00:51:11 As the need for behavioral
00:51:13 health care workers on the
00:51:16 spectrum of kay sky rocketed,
00:51:18 more are retiring from the
00:51:21 field, burning out due to
00:51:23 unaenable case loads or leaving
00:51:26 the sectsors for competitive pay
00:51:28 and benefits in the private
00:51:28 sector.
00:51:31 some of our city contracted
00:51:32 organizations providing
00:51:34 behavioral health service to the
00:51:35 acute individuals are
00:51:38 experiencing vacancy rates high
00:51:40 as 30-40%.
00:51:44 Within our own departments dph
00:51:46 behavioral health services has
00:51:49 144 vacancies the shortages
00:51:53 hindzer our ain't to provide
00:51:56 severe metal health crisis with
00:51:58 services and needed medical
00:51:58 care.
00:52:00 The shortage of data analyst
00:52:03 system making impossible for
00:52:05 policy makers to evaluate the
00:52:07 success or lack thereof of
00:52:09 interventions at work to address
00:52:10 the crisis.
00:52:12 Despite the acknowledged
00:52:14 workforce shortage san francisco
00:52:18 not implemented recruitment or
00:52:19 retention for any behavioral
00:52:22 healing worktory address the
00:52:25 high vacancies.
00:52:28 We bent over backward for police
00:52:30 department to address their
00:52:32 recruitment and retention
00:52:32 concerns.
00:52:34 I mentioned the board has
00:52:38 approved infusion of 149 million
00:52:39 in police department to help
00:52:41 sustain staffing levels and
00:52:44 funds incentives and increase
00:52:44 bonuses.
00:52:47 At the same time we made zero
00:52:48 investment in increasing the
00:52:49 behavioral healing
00:52:50 professionals.
00:52:52 I think it is fair it say the
00:52:55 mayor's office playing games
00:52:56 with san franciscans despite
00:53:00 lives hanging in the balance.
00:53:02 On one hand supports mental
00:53:04 health investments to address
00:53:08 issues present every day.
00:53:11 Supports health interventions
00:53:14 safe consumption sites and
00:53:17 treatment on demands instead of
00:53:19 opening the over dose prevention
00:53:22 centers we allocate funding for
00:53:24 focusing on the expansion of
00:53:26 treatment service or
00:53:29 prioritizing funds to pirecruit
00:53:32 and retain the health workers
00:53:35 skill in the draegsz the over
00:53:37 dose catastrophe.
00:53:39 Main strategy in the nation for
00:53:42 close to a century that has only
00:53:44 lead to ever worsening crisis we
00:53:45 see tuesday.
00:53:52 Time for us to rewatch the wire.
00:53:54 I think it is the most brilliant
00:53:58 depiction of the failure on the
00:54:01 war on drugs that reinstituting
00:54:03 in san francisco.
00:54:06 The mayor's ballot designed to
00:54:08 punish substance users in
00:54:10 assistance programs is the war
00:54:12 on drugs 2.0.
00:54:14 Arresting them and threeing them
00:54:16 in jail to be rerelease in the
00:54:18 the same conscience they were
00:54:21 before arrested is the war on
00:54:22 drugs 2.0.
00:54:25 Dumping minutes of dollars in
00:54:26 the police department without
00:54:28 fully staffing the health
00:54:31 department is worry on drugs
00:54:31 2.0.
00:54:33 When will we learn make mistakes
00:54:36 over and over again will never
00:54:37 produce different results.
00:54:39 This needs to stop now.
00:54:41 We need to stop trying to
00:54:43 address a public health issue
00:54:45 with criminalization special law
00:54:47 enforcement and spends our money
00:54:48 effectively.
00:54:50 Prioritizing initialives that
00:54:52 address the root causes.
00:54:56 We must fully fund and support
00:54:58 our health care workers save
00:54:59 lives every day.
00:55:00 I'm calling on the mayor's
00:55:03 office and department of human
00:55:04 resources to impelement an
00:55:06 emergency hiring plan includes
00:55:10 incentives recruitment and
00:55:12 retention to address the root
00:55:13 causes of the crisis experienced
00:55:16 by our city's poorest residents.
00:55:18 I want to thank supervisors
00:55:20 walton, peck perk, preston,
00:55:23 chan, melgar and safai for early
00:55:26 cosponsorship and look forward
00:55:28 to continuing this conversation
00:55:30 in a more balanced way.
00:55:31 And talking about health care
00:55:33 work and not police for every
00:55:36 problem we have in the city.
00:55:38 Secondly, today I will be
00:55:40 joining the mayor to in
00:55:42 introducing an ordinance to
00:55:44 extend the sunset deaf
00:55:45 authorizing the department of
00:55:48 homelessness and supportive
00:55:48 housing.
00:55:51 To enter in an amend contracts
00:55:53 without competitive bidding for
00:55:55 services related to cites for
00:55:56 people experiencing
00:55:56 homelessness.
00:55:58 When we pass this ordinance in
00:56:01 APRIL of 2919, we had a goal of
00:56:05 reducing home below 5, 250
00:56:06 people.
00:56:09 Despite progress we have not
00:56:11 achieved this goal and this
00:56:14 waiver has been critical to
00:56:16 opening new site to get people
00:56:19 off the streets and living in
00:56:21 temporary dignified and
00:56:24 long-term housing I hope you the
00:56:28 join me in extending this sunset
00:56:29 date and the rest I submit.

00:58:13 Okay.

00:59:32 I'm jordan pronounce she, her,
00:59:33 they, them.
00:59:35 Louder in the back I want to say
00:59:39 I'm tired of city employee and
00:59:42 contractors misupon gendering
00:59:45 people and they should be
00:59:45 firebirds.
00:59:46 Civil service and union
00:59:47 protectionings damned I have a
00:59:51 city employee I will not name
00:59:54 and auditor stalked me and
00:59:56 complainod twitter about
00:59:57 sensitivity training.
01:00:00 I think that this discourse on
01:00:03 public safety is heated instead
01:00:04 of solutions that create public
01:00:07 safety for all of us and not
01:00:10 just the -- this happens and
01:00:12 hart ras am by right wingers in
01:00:16 san francisco myself and others.
01:00:19 I a disabled transstalkd and
01:00:22 proved outside the, rein.
01:00:24 And threats to kill me with a
01:00:29 state worker dog mall and a gun
01:00:30 violence threat.
01:00:34 I screen shots and blame this
01:00:35 [Inaudible].
01:00:38 On mandelman's charter reform.
01:00:42 -- that -- switched to a council
01:00:44 manager system like san hose
01:00:45 competence all other 57 counties
01:00:48 in the state I plan to live my
01:00:50 life and have elected auditor
01:00:52 controller instead of appointed
01:00:55 by 54 other counties in the
01:00:56 state we never have good
01:00:58 gentleman you claim that sf is a
01:01:01 global city but don't care about
01:01:03 any good idea that it is within
01:01:07 a human miles when is wrong with
01:01:08 you people.
01:01:12 Nation, democracy, I am a
01:01:16 california girl I yield my time.
01:01:20 F, you.
01:01:20 Thank you for sharing your
01:01:21 comments.
01:01:21 next speaker, please.
01:01:26 I will wait for it to reset.
01:01:31 >> hello I'm leah mc gear I live
01:01:36 in d6 and I want top continue
01:01:39 reading the protection
01:01:43 transgender, and queer youth and
01:01:43 adults.
01:01:46 This left week has been rough.
01:01:50 Being a transact viv in san
01:01:51 francisco.
01:01:53 Piggybacking off what jordan was
01:01:55 talking about and I'm like
01:01:57 reading through this.
01:02:02 I'm like, I didn't expect when
01:02:06 my wife came out as transand
01:02:09 DECEMBER 2021 and I quickly got
01:02:11 on board and learned you know
01:02:14 where I was ignorant of when
01:02:17 that meant to be trans.
01:02:20 And you know being vocal about
01:02:22 educating people and protecting
01:02:24 upon transkids and fighting
01:02:26 against the tide of the
01:02:29 transphobia and all the lus
01:02:29 passing.
01:02:32 In the country, I really didn't
01:02:35 expect to be so attacked by
01:02:38 local san franciscans even those
01:02:40 in city hall.
01:02:42 Who hide behind unanimous online
01:02:44 social media accounts and say
01:02:49 vile horrid things about me and
01:02:51 jordan and I don't know why they
01:02:53 are not attacking [Inaudible]
01:02:55 Trans phobia is not the problem.
01:03:00 Homo phobia is not the problem.
01:03:03 So -- just it is irrelevant
01:03:05 draining.
01:03:06 It is in the fun.
01:03:08 But it is like the most
01:03:10 important thing one of the most
01:03:13 important things that I can be
01:03:16 fighting for now and I really
01:03:17 wish everyone will thousand and
01:03:20 take that to heart.
01:03:21 Thank you.
01:03:22 Thank you for sharing your
01:03:31 comments next speaker, please
01:03:35 I'm jay conor and copresident of
01:03:39 d3 I want to have the sproirss
01:03:42 mute mics.
01:03:46 I am impressed with the spooky
01:03:48 costumes you chose today.
01:03:49 Successful leaders is in the one
01:03:52 had guess out of style.
01:03:54 A friends of mine visit mow in
01:03:58 sf and saw the tents, drug
01:04:02 addicts the estate attempt tom
01:04:04 have a spooky hall wean I said
01:04:06 no that's what the city likes
01:04:08 like daily and he getting worse.
01:04:11 With a glimmer of hope I'm glad
01:04:14 the city is cleaned up in time
01:04:17 for apeck and show the leaders
01:04:19 we are not a mess when the board
01:04:21 does in the feel it is important
01:04:22 to keep it clone in in order.
01:04:25 The question I have is why can't
01:04:28 we have clean streets no tents
01:04:32 no drug dealers not anywhere, I
01:04:34 said left week like all the
01:04:35 neighborhoods and cities.
01:04:39 Every day.
01:04:40 And supervisors, the day you all
01:04:42 support treatment instead.
01:04:46 Drug denies when we properly
01:04:48 address mental health when it
01:04:51 dmos drug addiction what brings
01:04:53 me joy as copresident of d3 we
01:04:56 are seeing and going to be
01:04:58 organizing a new ballot
01:05:01 initiative to break the kroeflt
01:05:01 board.
01:05:03 What should bring you fear is
01:05:06 the people of san francisco are
01:05:08 losing if not already lost faith
01:05:10 in the board and are recognizing
01:05:13 the needs to elect better
01:05:15 leaders or redesign how our city
01:05:16 government is structured.
01:05:18 Thank you.
01:05:21 >> thanks thank you for sharing
01:05:22 your comments next speaker,
01:05:22 please.
01:05:23 Hi.
01:05:27 Nice to see friend low face.
01:05:31 I'm going to talk I'm in d8.
01:05:33 I was going to talk about the
01:05:34 police staffing issue but
01:05:37 supervisor ronen you nail today
01:05:40 that was awe some.
01:05:44 You know in very recently a
01:05:47 study concluded a review of the
01:05:50 62 studies of patrol staffing
01:05:53 relate to crime rates.
01:05:55 Now, it was conclubhousive exit
01:05:58 will read had they wrote.
01:05:59 The over all affect for police
01:06:02 force size on crime is negative,
01:06:05 small and not significant of the
01:06:07 authors of the study are
01:06:09 criminologist across the
01:06:10 spectrum.
01:06:13 They are in part conducted by
01:06:16 law enforcement and funding.
01:06:18 Authors wrote in conclusion this
01:06:21 line of research exhausted
01:06:22 utilities changing police
01:06:24 strategy is likely it have I
01:06:28 great impact than adding more
01:06:30 police.
01:06:32 Portland, oregon has half as
01:06:35 many police as we have.
01:06:38 To the decimal point and the
01:06:41 exact same crime rate.
01:06:44 54.4 per 10,000 people.
01:06:46 I know you have constate webs to
01:06:47 answer to and you are
01:06:49 representatives and go and say,
01:06:52 hey, these data show you are
01:06:52 safe.
01:06:54 I know you don't feel safe.
01:06:58 But you also have a duty to make
01:07:00 things safer.
01:07:03 A duty to show I'm going to make
01:07:04 it safer.
01:07:07 Police staffing is not it we
01:07:11 need behavioral health 17% of
01:07:13 homeless are employed house some
01:07:13 people to start.
01:07:15 There is a lot we can do with
01:07:19 the money for the city to make
01:07:20 it safer.
01:07:22 Thank you.

01:09:47 MR. Duffy.
01:09:49 MR. PRESIDENT I like the idea of
01:09:52 looking at issues in the city
01:09:53 and things that are chronically
01:09:55 a problem for years like
01:09:56 homelessness and try to think of
01:09:58 a different way of doing it.
01:10:00 I like that idea.
01:10:01 Charter reform.
01:10:04 I don't know how it would work
01:10:18 out.
01:10:20 Working on for example.
01:10:21 Problems like when does the
01:10:23 federal reserve control.
01:10:23 When?
01:10:25 Or when has it is u noticed
01:10:27 nations ever stopped worries

01:10:51 have public safety looking out
01:10:54 for us.
01:10:55 Great job to the police
01:10:56 department.
01:10:58 The second thing had dog my
01:11:00 research I noticed something
01:11:01 that everyone the board of
01:11:03 supervisors should be aware of.
01:11:07 Looking at the cdc court
01:11:09 quarantine stations and san
01:11:11 francisco and northern
01:11:13 california linked to wyoming.
01:11:16 And I don't think anybody wants
01:11:19 wyoming influencing our
01:11:21 decisions.
01:11:22 That's what is happening worse
01:11:25 when you look at los angeles,
01:11:28 lsx they cover nevada, utah and
01:11:29 colorado.
01:11:30 Anybody this is traveling to
01:11:35 nevada, las vegas, utah, they
01:11:38 bring back this influence and
01:11:40 that's where your problems texas
01:11:41 is worse.
01:11:44 It is 3 important everdifferent
01:11:46 states influence texas someone
01:11:50 should look at the cdc
01:11:51 quarantine station.
